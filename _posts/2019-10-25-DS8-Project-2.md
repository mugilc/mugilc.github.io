A map of New York City's complaint data (felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes) from 2006 to 2015:

As a resident of the New York metropolitan area and a frequent visitor of Manhattan, I've often wondered about crime in New York City and whether or not certain types of crime occur more frequently in Manhattan or the other boroughs. So I decided to take a look at crime data for New York City and more specifically, a dataset provided by [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) which includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) for all complete quarters so far this year (2019).

After doing some initial cleaning on the dataset, this was the value count I had for number of complaints:

However, due to the fact that most of my visits to New York City tend to be in Manhattan, I wanted to predict whether the crimes in the dataset occurred in Manhattan or not. I also wanted to take a look into what factors help determine whether a crime happened in Manhattan or not.

In order to prevent leakage, I had to remove all columns in the dataset which included specific location information, such as longitude and latitude, and specific police codes for each borough. After doing that and cleaning the data for null values, I used a random forest classifier to predict whether crime occurred in Manhattan or not. These were the top features I found:

You can find the descriptions of the column names over here at [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243).

From here, I wanted to look further into the top features and take a look into why these were the top features. For 'PREM_TYP_DESC', a specific description of premises, it appeared that in Manhattan, crimes happened more in public housing, chain stores, and commercial buildings than in the other boroughs. And for the other boroughs, crimes happened more in houses.

The other top feature was 'SUSP_RACE', which was a description of the suspect's race. While there was still a difference between the data for the two locations (Manhattan or other), the difference was not significant.

In conclusion, there does not appear to be a great way to predict which borough crime in New York City occurred in. After removing all potential columns with leakage (those with location specific information), this was the features and weights for all the remaining columns using ELI5:

None of the features had significant values for weight, and as such, I can conclude that there isn't any specific crime that occurs more in Manhattan than the other boroughs, or vice versa. The biggest differences I found seemed to be due to the premise type descriptions, which likely is due to the different types of premises in Manhattan and the other boroughs - Manhattan tends to have more retail spaces, and commercial buildings, where as the other boroughs tend to have more houses.
