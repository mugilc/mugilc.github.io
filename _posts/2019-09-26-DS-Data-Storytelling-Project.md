title: Value of NBA Players by Salary
subtitle: An analysis of the relationship between win shares and salary
---

As an avid fan of the NBA, I often find myself questioning whether some of the players I watch on a nightly basis are paid too much for their performance, or lack thereof. At the same time, I also often wondered maybe some of the players who are contributing more are underpaid in comparison to their peers.

So I decided to take a look into this and try to determine which players are the most and least valuable in terms of their contribution in relation to their salaries. Although there is no one single statistic in basketball that can clearly determine a player's worth in basketball, I decided to use win shares for the purpose of my project. Win shares estimate an individual player's contribution to their team's win total. Details about the statistic can be found [here](http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html).

I found the data for my project on [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a great resource for anyone looking for basketball statistics. After cleaning the data I acquired, I was able to come up with a list of the highest paid players, and the players who had the most win shares.

However, what I was most interested in was finding out which players were the least and the most valuable to their teams in terms of their contribution in win shares in relation to their salary. Here is what I found:

For the column 'value', I divided the number of win shares each player had, by their salary for the 2019-2020 season. Because the values were so small and slighly difficult to interpret, I multiplied the values by 1,000,0000 to make it easier to read.

I understand that this analysis is still far from complete, and that there are a lot of other factors to take into account in determining a player's value to their teams, it was still interesting to see the results of the data and see which players were the least and most valuable in terms of win shares / salary. For example, Pascal Siakam led the way for the players in the top 20 most valuable by contributing over 9 win shares.
